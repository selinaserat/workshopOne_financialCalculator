This application implements two different calculators; a mortgage calculator and a calculator that finds the future value of a CD. The screen is prompted to select which calculator they would like to use. 



# interesting code
One interesting piece of code is the switch, with the cases. It's interesting because as someone that had learned basic Java, including if statemtns and loops, I was never taught the switch method, which is way easier and more readable.
